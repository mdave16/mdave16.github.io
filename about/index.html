<p>Not sure what to put here. I have an about page, do you?</p>

<p>I'm Mayur Dave and I make scripts and notes relating to maths.</p>

<p>I am a fourth year mathematician at Warwick.
I have my notes available online on this website.
Ask if there is anything you want up! You can also ask about coding and teaching.</p>
