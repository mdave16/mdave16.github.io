<h1>Hey!</h1>

<p>
	I'm Mayur Dave and I am a polyglot software engineer at eBay. I enjoy
	mathematics, hiking and board games. I have my old maths notes available
	online on this website. <a href="/contact">Reach out</a> if there is anything
	you want up! You can also ask about coding and teaching.
</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I'm currently working on:</p>
{% assign projects = site.github.public_repositories 
	| where_exp: "project", "project.homepage" 
	| where_exp: "project", "project.fork == false" 
	| where_exp: "project", "project.homepage != ''" %}
{% assign one_page_projects = "Blog, Tic Tac Toe, Tic Tac Tic Tac Toe" | split: ", " %}

<ul>
	{% for project in one_page_projects %}
	<li><a href="/{{project | slugify}}">{{project}}</a></li>
	{% endfor %} {% for repository in projects %}
	<li><a href="{{repository.homepage}}">{{repository.name | strip }}</a></li>
	{% endfor %}
</ul>

Give me <a href="/contact">feedback</a> if there is anything wrong, or if you
feel there is something I could change!
