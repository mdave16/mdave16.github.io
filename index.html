<h1>Hey!</h1>

<p>
	I'm Mayur Dave and I am a polyglot software engineer at eBay. I enjoy
	mathematics, hiking and board games. I have my old maths notes available
	online on this website. <a href="/contact.html">Reach out</a> if there is
	anything you want up! You can also ask about coding and teaching.
</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I'm currently working on:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/bored">Bored button</a></li>
	<li><a href="/tic-tac-toe.html">Tic Tac Toe</a></li>
	<li><a href="/tic-tac-tic-tac-toe.html">Tic Tac Tic Tac Toe</a></li>
	<li><a href="/cryptography">Cryptography</a></li>
</ul>

Give me <a href="/contact.html">feedback</a> if there is anything wrong, or if
you feel there is something I could change!
