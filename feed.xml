Spend some time writing a script to do it for you. Got a bigger problem? Write a service which fixes it for you. Want to solve problems with software engineering? Use Token Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Blog/Posts/_resampled/FillWyI4MDAiLDU1MF0/IMG-1641.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Developer looking at screen.&quot; title=&quot;How to fix this?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A developer in the wild can be confronted by many problems. Some of these problems will be slow or repetitive tasks, some will be the lack of adoption of tools which could help, and some will be convincing others that the first two are problems. How does the developer manage to fend off these problems?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way the humble developer might fix this problem is by massaging any pain points when they see fit and working away on making everything pristine. While this seems like an appropriate solution, it only works in the short term. In the long term, it’s not cost effective and when the business suffers, so does the developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another solution is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://leadingagileteams.com/2015/09/01/making-time-for-personal-development-gold-cards/&quot;&gt;Gold Cards&lt;/a&gt; — tickets that the developer can present to the team which allows them to work on personal development for half a day per week, for a total of one day per two-week sprint. However, we didn’t want a time limit to pressure our tinkering. It also wouldn’t work because we are a team who continuously delivers rather than using sprints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here at Shutl, we created something called The Token. The Token is a physical statue with wrenches, as shown above. While it is a physical object, The Token is more of an idea. Whomever has The Token can work on an issue that annoys them and that they feel fixing would improve their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One benefit from The Token is that there is no backlog to circumvent, no product owners or business people to convince. The reason this works is due to trust. There is a high level of trust among the developers and, in turn, we feel trusted and supported. Whenever we have a pain point, we know that we can simply take The Token and fix it the way we do best, by programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chose this solution because we believe it is empowering. Shutl is made up entirely of motivated individuals. The Token gives them support to do their jobs with full autonomy. Allowing our engineers to develop in such a way has been empowering for us, making us feel like players rather than pawns and ensuring we have &lt;a href=&quot;https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/&quot;&gt;a healthy team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit we gain is having space to fail. It is important to have space to fail in order to innovate. If you have an idea that could help, but does not work, that’s OK. By having the space to fail, you can experiment freely and explore, which allows us to be innovative. Most new technologies and concepts started off as a token task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s safe to say The Token has been a success. Since its introduction, we’ve had fewer problems, and the team has been generally happier. In the beginning, the token was used very often, but as time goes on we’ve used the token less. At the moment there are no plans to change or improve on The Token. The Token is just a tool for improving our code quality, which it has done and continues to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a silver bullet, however; it’s important to consider any downfalls. One possible concern is that by giving the engineers free rein, they may not work on what the business needs. However, by having one token and, at most, one ongoing job at any given time, we can be sure that there will still be deliverable change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear existence of a token, and the ongoing work on tokens can slow down the pace of delivery in the short term. However, having a nicer and healthier system leads to happier developers and can speed up the pace of delivery in the long term. Although not new, we know most extreme programming practices lead to long-term solutions of sustainable development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of the main tools that were developed in-house started off as Token jobs.
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static//assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzMzMCwzMzJd/shipship-logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;shipship&quot; title=&quot;shipship&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;ShipShip&lt;/a&gt;: We found a problem with coordinating stand ups and deployments with the USA. We took The Token, built a very simple version of the one seen here. We solved the stand up issue and made it easier to deploy. ShipShip has been improved since then, but the difficult first step was a token job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/logo.svg&quot; alt=&quot;failbot&quot; title=&quot;failbot&quot; height=&quot;330&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;FailBot&lt;/a&gt;: We had an issue with flaky tests and being unsure if a failure was real or not. Once again, The Token gave us a start with FailBot, which was considerably improved on by later Token jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, the token has been serving us well. It has certainly helped us find solutions, from keeping track of stories to ensuring we are not blocked by flaky tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things work best when engineers do what they do best and automate the problems away. Ultimately, The Token is simply an efficient means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;mdave248&quot;}</name></author><category term="Agile" /><category term="Coding Practices" /><category term="Internal Open Source" /><category term="eBay" /><category term="Developer Tools" /><category term="Culture" /><category term="Shutl" /><summary type="html">Got a problem?

To keep everyone on the same page with the different projects that they are working on, we built a tool called ShipShip to help keep information flowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ShipShip is an automated Kanban Board that fetches information from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, our internal deployment platform, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenkins.io/&quot;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt;, stitches everything together, and throws out an automated Kanban Board that moves with pull requests, builds, and deployments. The only manual step in the process is to manually verify each story in QA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started out as a quick tool created as a part of my internship to show deployment status for every commit on our master branch. After the initial version was released, we kept adding more and more helpful features, and now it is a stand-alone service we use every day for stand-ups and deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We strive for continuous delivery, working closely to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/&quot;&gt;GitHub flow&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, for each piece of work, we create a pull request. When ready, after review, it is merged back to master. After going through a CI, we check our changes in QA/staging before deploying master to production. We have built ShipShip to work around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;The zen of the github flow&quot; src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzYwMCw1MV0/Screen-Shot-2018-12-19-at-22.23.22.png&quot; alt=&quot;Analysis -&amp;gt; Coding &amp;lt;-&amp;gt; Review -&amp;gt; Validate -&amp;gt; Deploy&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Shutl, we use seven columns to track the progress of anything, as shown in the following figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Kanban Overview&quot; src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzYwMCwzMzhd/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-16.14.43.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kanban Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s follow a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;A sample card from the Review column&quot; src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzQwMCwyMzld/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-17.04.54.png&quot; alt=&quot;A sample card from the Review column&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the conflicts in this pull request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the card that opens when a new pull request is opened, usually in the “in progress”, or the “review” columns, indicating whether it is ready or still being worked on. It allows you to see the team, the repo, the author — all the usual suspects, as taken from Git, and our deployment tool. It also shows conflicts and whether the PR build has failing tests. The only difference between work in progress and review is if you have tagged it for review on Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzM5OCwyNDJd/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-16.15.07.png&quot; title=&quot;A card which is merged but not deployed&quot; alt=&quot;A card which is merged but not deployed&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grey clock symbolizes that this is merged and not yet deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzQwMCwzMzJd/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-17.15.48.png&quot; title=&quot;Engineer Approval&quot; alt=&quot;Engineer Approval&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In QA, the engineer checks it out. Notice this is the first time you’ve interacted with ShipShip directly. You sign off whether the change has the desired effect on QA. Shortly after, a product manager will run an acceptance test to say this is indeed the changes requested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzM5OSwyMDZd/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-17.24.14.png&quot; title=&quot;Product Approval&quot; alt=&quot;Product Approval&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A reset button has been provided for mis-clicks and misunderstandings. If there’s something to communicate, you can even comment to point things out. To filter out some noise, there are filters for individual users, projects, and teams. Here we are going to filter cards that are being worked on by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebaytech.london/2017/05/feature-teams-101/&quot;&gt;Moshpit team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzYwMCw2N10/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-17.16.27.png&quot; title=&quot;You can filter by team, project and user.&quot; alt=&quot;Applying filters to the kanban board.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.ebayinc.com/static/assets/Uploads/Editor/_resampled/ResizedImageWzQwMCwyNThd/Screen-Shot-2018-11-29-at-17.16.01.png&quot; title=&quot;Filter in use.&quot; alt=&quot;Filter in use.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to be more visual, there are also “blocker” and “blocked” tags. The banners also auto neutralize when a broken PR is fixed by a later PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making sure your card has no blockers, you can deploy, and the card will move to the correct column. There’s also a detailed view of cards for when you want to revisit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has helped us support each other better as engineers and has been key in helping communication between different teams. It was also a great way for me to learn the whole lifecycle of the development process as an &lt;a href=&quot;https://ebaytech.london/2018/03/internship/&quot;&gt;intern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>{&quot;twitter&quot;=&gt;&quot;mdave248&quot;}</name></author><category term="Internal Tools" /><category term="eBay" /><category term="Agile" /><category term="Developer Tools" /><category term="Interns" /><category term="New Hires" /><category term="Culture" /><category term="Shutl" /><category term="Ruby" /><summary type="html">At eBay, each development team works with multiple distributed teams.
