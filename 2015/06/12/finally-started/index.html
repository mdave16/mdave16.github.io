			<h1>Finally started blogging again</h1>

			<p>
				Finally, started blogging again, this time with purpose. I and a few of
				my friends will be looking into how mathematicians of the past could
				have found what they did. The basic structure of these will be:
			</p>

			<p>
				1) Hey, I wonder… How many …? What is the size of … for …? How do …. and
				…. relate? or are they unrelated?
			</p>

			<p>
				2) Using mathematics we have learnt so far, completely rigorously,
				trying to show that a function will behave in a certain way at certain
				points
			</p>

			<p>
				3) Numerical analysis, once all our deductions have been used it might
				be useful to analyse what we do.
			</p>

			<p>
				4) Graphing and changing all the variables. ‘Maths by Computer’ saving
				the day, also with the above.
			</p>

			<p>
				5) Discussing results, talking about how to make algorithms faster,
				using what we learn, spotting patterns and making conjectures and then
				going back to step 2, until we have a formula and have rigorously proved
				why it is the case. - Or realized that this is, unfortunately, beyond
				us, and look it up, have a laugh and good think, and move on.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before you get all impressed, or thinking we’re over-achievers, these
				results should be fairly trivial, and within our grasp, we could look
				them up at any point, but we are trying to do the research ourselves.
				One day, we may be at a point, where we cannot just look it up, it is
				just practice for then :)
			</p>

			<p>
				I have done some, just not written up yet, will type those up in LaTeX
				and then move on to doing the others.
			</p>
