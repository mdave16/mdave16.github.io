# Hey!

I'm Mayur Dave and I am a polyglot software engineer at eBay. I enjoy mathematics, hiking, and board games. I have my old maths notes available online on this website. [Reach out](contact "Contact me") if there is anything
you want up! You can also ask about coding and teaching.

Here are some of the things I'm currently working on:

- [Tic Tac Toe](tic-tac-toe.html)
- [Tic Tac Tic Tac Toe](tic-tac-tic-tac-toe.html "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe")
- [Blog](blog.html "Personal Blog")
- [Warwick Blog](https://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/mdave/ "Old blog from uni, I plan to deprecate this soon")
- [cryptography](https://mdave16.github.io/cryptography "Visualisation of basic ciphers")

Give me [feedback](contact "Contact me") if there is anything wrong, or if you
feel there is something I could change!
