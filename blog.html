					Programming Tools and Information Systems
					<p>
						Consider the following framework for thinking about our work as
						software engineers. There is a product that you maintain, and
						something is not working as the customer wants it to, either since
						it’s a bug or a feature they want or need. The first step is to use
						information at our disposal in order to learn about our product, so
						to make a decision of the solution. The second step is to optimally
						implement that solution.

						So I’ve had a website on pythonanywhere for a while now. I’ve

						I was talking to my friend Jack, and he reminded me that to be
						really giving 100% as a mathematician, or as whatever you are, you
						really need to be giving 100% on everything. You need to be eating
						well, you need to be sleeping well, you need to be relaxing well, to

						I just started my URSS with being given a complicated title and some

					<p>
						So this is me writing up the thing about the hockey stick theorem
						from first year. It can be found in the notes section. Was a nice
						find back then. I even got to do a talk about it and explain it to
						some college classes. Just to clarify – this isn’t world leading
						research, it’s just a first year thinking ahead a little bit.
