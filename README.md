# mdave16.github.io
Initially built following the "http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/" guide.
Since then I've decided to learn more about jekyll and build the website without
any extras.

Final website "http://mdave16.github.io/"!

# setting up!
run  `bundle install`

# running locally!
run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

and preview the site at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost::4000)
