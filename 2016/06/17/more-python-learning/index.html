			<h1>More python learning</h1>

			<p>Follow-up to Learning Python in a new way</p>

			<p>
				So far i’ve got fairly far with PythonChallenge and it’s been good fun
				discovering all these modules and aspects of python i didn’t previously
				know about.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most of what I do in python or indeed any language is just to solve
				equations and so it’s been particularly fun just learning a language
				like this.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another website which was good was https://Check.io . There is an
				interactive world in which you use Python to solve challenges and go
				further in life. With active members on the forums to direct you
				whenever you are lost means no step is too big.
			</p>

			<p>
				Further along, another website is https://trinket.io which allows you to
				share snippets of running python (only with standard libraries). You can
				share them as code and program, or quite simply just program. A nice
				tool for learning how to code in python without having to mess with the
				terminal or an IDE.
			</p>
