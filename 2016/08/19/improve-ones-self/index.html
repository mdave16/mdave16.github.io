			<h1>Improve One's Self</h1>

			<p>
				I was talking to my friend Jack, and he reminded me that to be really
				giving 100% as a mathematician, or as whatever you are, you really need
				to be giving 100% on everything. You need to be eating well, you need to
				be sleeping well, you need to be relaxing well, to work well.
			</p>

			<p>
				The main tip he offered me, was to make a calendar. Each day you achieve
				your goal, you cross that day off on the calendar. Once you achieve 30
				days of success, you’ve made it a habit! (with hope). Each day you
				don’t, you restart the count. Making it more and more painful. It only
				requires some initial will power, which he’s willing to provide for me.
			</p>

			<p>
				It should work to help cure my sleep, and improve my eating habits.
				After that I can take aim for the 1st I really don’t deserve, but am
				capable of.
			</p>

			<p>
				He also said not to improve too many things at a time, and only stick to
				two, or one if I want to. Which sounds like sound advice.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you hadn’t noticed, I do love puns and play on words, as well as
				using words in their multitude of meanings.
			</p>

			<p>
				Hopefully by the end of summer, I’ll finally become better, and update
				the documents I keep saying I will
			</p>
