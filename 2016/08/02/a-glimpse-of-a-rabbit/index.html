			<h1>A glimpse of a rabbit</h1>

			<p>
				I just started my URSS with being given a complicated title and some
				papers I don’t understand. I’m told it’s actually very simple, but from
				the outside it certainly doesn’t feel so.
			</p>

			<p>
				I set out on the quest for my rabbit. Once I see the fluffy tail of the
				rabbit, and can identify which one is the right rabbit. It’s simply a
				question of going down the rabbit hole, until nothing makes sense
				without 4/5 hours of explaining. This is what I feel research will be
				like.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’ve been going through the shorter of the papers, hoping it would also
				be the simpler one. It was also the paper my supervisor told me to start
				with, so one can hope it is simple. A few lines in I’m already met with
				words I have heard in passing but never understood and simple words
				which I do understand attached to words I don’t, meaning even the little
				hope I had of understanding it was lost.
			</p>

			<p>
				Marc advised that I go through the paper slowly and it should start to
				make much more sense. So I take a large piece of paper and write down
				these words, look up their definitions and try to understand each one
				and continue. All of a sudden, I see a white hair. It looks like a
				rabbit.
			</p>

			<p>
				Upon closer inspection, I had caught a glimpse of the rabbit. Soon after
				I found the whole of the rabbit.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rabbit, for those wondering, was I needed to compute an initial
				“Perfect Form” given from a brute force search in O^2 where O is the
				maximal order in Q(-sqrt(d)) where d was my input. Still seems hard to
				grasp, but at least it was digestible.
			</p>

			<p>
				I start to code comments of the break points and get started on catching
				up to the rabbit. As well as understanding more of the definitions. In
				time, I think it’s doable. Rome wasn’t build in a day.
