			<h1>New Website?</h1>

			<p>
				So I’ve had a website on pythonanywhere for a while now. I’ve enjoyed
				using flask but it does have it’s limitations. I feel there could be a
				greater community working at giving help, and in general just to
				compile.
			</p>

			<p>
				Considering flask is a micro framework (as in it’s just bare bones), it
				really should be easy to learn. I’m not sure what it says about me as a
				programmer if I can’t learn it that well.
			</p>

			<p>
				Either way, I will upload the tutorial to build a site from nothing
				using it ( an even more bare-bones replica of my current site). Along
				with video (hopefully).
			</p>

			<p>
				I’ve recently changed my Linux laptop yet again to OpenSuse and it’s
				seeming ok, so once I’m fully set up i’ll start producing it.
