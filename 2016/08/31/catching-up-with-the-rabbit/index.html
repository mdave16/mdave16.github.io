			<h1>Catching up with the rabbit</h1>

			<p>Follow-up to A glimpse of a rabbit</p>

			<p>
				So the last time I wrote about this, I was simply reading up on the
				mathematics behind what I was doing. I started programming in SAGE and
				as always there are a few hiccups with it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m mostly just trying to replicate Yasaki’s results in this language,
				but it is harder than I had thought. As with most programming projects
				I’ve ever undertaken, there always is a horrible messy debug/write cycle
				in the middle, but this is more horrendous than usual. Anyway, I’m
				getting on with it, learning lots about what research is like, also
				getting quite a bit closer with Marc my supervisor.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m really enjoying the URSS and for anyone who is vaguely interested in
				doing it, I would highly recommend it. I think I’ve learned that
				research would actually be very fun, and really something I want to do
				(provided the right topic), however I’ve been lazy for too many years to
				suddenly become smart overnight and keep up.
			</p>

			<p>
				If only I’d known many years ago, that this is something I want to do,
				and to not fall victim to the plague that is laziness. I think I’m
				keeping up okay despite my lack of hard work in previous years, I just
				keep thinking “If I had tried, then maybe I would have understood this
				better/faster”. Perhaps it’s just thinking the field is always greener
				on the other side, and even if I had tried, it would not be easier.
				However, my gut instinct is to say it is indeed the way it sounds.
			</p>
