			<h1>New Collaboration</h1>

			<p>Follow-up to charc_math 1.0</p>

			<p>
				My friend Ben (FleaRex) has decided to help me with my module, by
				ordering it in a nicer way and also adding in his own functions. Theres
				also a few more I’d like to add based off my work with the URSS.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of them is spiral.py which iterates over things of a given norm. The
				others are norm.py and some others, although I’m going to see if NumPy
				has an implementation I’m after.
			</p>

			<p>
				Again, the majority of these functions are really just for me, I just
				thought they’d be useful for others. With Ben now also working on it,
				this may change and it may become more friendly to other users. I’m also
				going to see if he can come up with a better name.
			</p>

			<p>
				While this is happening, I may also create a python3 version, and slowly
				start moving there. SciPy is supported in it, and so really I have
				little excuse of going there. I’m also thinking after a while I’ll move
				to another language, one which is better for mathematicians. I’ve still
				got plenty of coding to learn and still Bash to conquer, so i think this
				will make a nice hobby.
			</p>
