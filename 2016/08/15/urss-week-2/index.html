			<h1>URSS week 2</h1>

			<p>
				So I’d reflected on the first week before, and thought I’d do it for the
				other weeks too.
			</p>

			<p>
				It seems I actually understood quite a bit of the theory wrong, this
				week has been quite unproductive in terms of getting far. I seem to
				slightly understand what I’m doing, but it’s not really sinking in.
			</p>

			<p>
				It goes off the work from Yasaki, Gunnels and also (Andrew) Jones’s
				Thesis. I’m just struggling getting a few things to work. Marc has been
				really quite helpful in making sure I understand it all and helping me
				also code in sage by teaching me about shortcuts\methods which i’d not
				seen before.
			</p>

			<p>
				I think I should be able to have a working program by Wednesday (I
				hope).
			</p>

			<p>
				I also wanted to upload a clean/improved version of my essay on Complex
				Multiplication, which I will at some point.
