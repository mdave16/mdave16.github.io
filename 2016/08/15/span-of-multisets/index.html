			<h1>Span of Multisets</h1>

			<p>
				We haven’t written anything yet, but me and a friend are looking at
				something we’ve called the ‘span’ of a set.
			</p>

			<p>
				Basically, given a multiset, and a set of operations, what are all the
				numbers you can construct, when only using one number from the set
				exactly once. It seems to be quite a complicated question, and I think
				it would be part of Combinatorics/Graph Theory (since that’s how we’re
				rewriting a lot of the questions). We’re going to work on it when we
				have some spare time and probably put the pdf on here when done.
