				So this is me writing up the thing about the hockey stick theorem from
				first year. It can be found in the notes section. Was a nice find back
				then. I even got to do a talk about it and explain it to some college
				classes. Just to clarify – this isn’t world leading research, it’s just
				a first year thinking ahead a little bit.
