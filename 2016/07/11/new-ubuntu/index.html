			<h1>New Ubuntu</h1>

			<p>
				So I’ve finally published the module to Pypi, and I’ve also updated the
				ubuntu on my pc. I decided to go for a fresh install and not let my
				files gather into messes like they usually end up doing.
			</p>

			<p>
				It’s rather clean and nice. I’ve also mastered the terminal so
				installation was much easier this time. I was thinking since this is
				basically a dead blog, I could move it to my actual website, give me a
				chance to put my HTML/CSS/JS skills into action.
			</p>

			<p>This might be something I do once I’ve graduated.</p>

			<p>
				I didn’t get as high as I wanted with my results, so I might not be
				publishing that much. – Even less than I already do!
			</p>

			<p>
				I also made a new Gmail – one with a professional name this time. So I
				might start uploading youtube how-to videos about the things I’ve done.
				I know I would have appreciated a really good how to video when I was
				doing various things, and maybe this would even help other people.
