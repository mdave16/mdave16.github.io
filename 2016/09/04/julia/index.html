			<h1>Julia</h1>

			<p>
				This is about the programming language
				<a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				While talking to Marc, he told me about a previous Warwick student who
				had helped quite a bit with the development of SAGE, but had in recent
				years taken to Julia.
			</p>

			<p>
				It was at this moment that I realised that SAGE, Magma, Mathematica and
				MATLAB are not just the big players, but just a mere handful of them. On
				Julia’s website, we can see benchmarks against various other languages,
				some which I’ve used but not for intense maths like JS and Java (or
				arguably Python), and some which I’ve only heard about being difficult.
			</p>

			<p>
				Taking inspiration, I’m thinking about what languages can I branch out
				to? I’ve already taken a step towards Julia. I’m thinking of giving
				Rails a go for my website, and I could also try php? I’ve heard many bad
				things about php, but they can’t all be true. Could they?!
			</p>

			<p>
				Bash is also one I’ve been meaning to learn for some time now, so that
				would be good. There are all the variations of C I have yet to learn. I
				really only know C (the normal one). Go, Haskel, Lua…
			</p>

			<p>
				My friend Ollie, I recently found, went up to 100 (+) on Project Euler,
				I know this is something I keep meaning to do. It certainly motivates me
				to do so, it’s an admirable quality. He along with Jack are trying to
				coerce me into playing chess too, so that might happen sooner or later.
				Lots to happen.
			</p>
