## Experience

- [Shutl][_shutl] (Oct 17 -- Present)
  - **Software Engineer Intern** (Oct 17 -- March 18)
  - **Full Stack Polyglot Software Engineer** (March 18 -- Present)

As a polyglot and a full stack software engineer, I would be working everywhere in the stack and was able to pick up languages and frameworks with relative ease.
Whilst also going through engineering duties, I would also host Brownbags, a recurring section where talks would be given on new technologies, in order to keep the team innovative.

## Education

- [University of Warwick][_wwk] (Sep 13 -- Jul 17)
  - **Master of Mathematics** 2:1

## Projects

- Research project on **Computing Bianchi Modular Forms** supervised by Research Fellow [**Marc Masdeu**][_mm].

Computing Bianchi Modular Forms was theoretically possible, but nobody had written a program to practically calculate them. The project consisted of reading research papers, and implementing algorithms described. The next challenge was optimisation of these advanced algorithms.
