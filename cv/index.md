Teaching
--------

I am a cheerful experienced teacher, having taught both in classrooms and 
one on one. I can learn very quickly on the job, reacting to my audience, 
making sure nobody is left behind when covering the basics. Having taught 
a large volume of students from a wide range of skill levels, so would be 
able to help even the most able minded students.

During my time at LGS, I was slowly introduced to classroom teaching. 
Towards the end, I was teaching the classroom entirely on my own, 
including planning and marking.

Coding
------

Quick learner - being able to pick up new languages typically 
within a fortnight. I've worked on quite a few projects as 
coursework as well as for experimental purposes. Although the 
vast majority is for mathematical work, I am adaptable and can 
code for any purpose.
