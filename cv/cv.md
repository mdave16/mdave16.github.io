Teaching
--------

I am a cheerful experienced teacher, having taught both in classrooms and
one on one. I can learn very quickly on the job, reacting to my audience,
making sure nobody is left behind when covering the basics. Having taught
a large volume of students from a wide range of skill levels, so would be
able to help even the most able minded students.

During my time at LGS, I was slowly introduced to classroom teaching.
Towards the end, I was teaching the classroom entirely on my own,
including planning and marking.

Coding

vast majority is for mathematical work, I am adaptable and can
code for any purpose.
