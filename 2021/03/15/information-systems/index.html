			<h1>Information Systems</h1>

			<p>
				I have had this idea, but have been unable to come up for the vocabulary
				for it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consider the following framework for thinking about our work as software
				engineers. There is a product that you maintain, and something is not
				working as the customer wants it to, either since it’s a bug or a
				feature they want or need. The first step is to use information at our
				disposal in order to learn about our product, so to make a decision of
				the solution. The second step is to optimally implement that solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given this framework, there are lots of books that tell you how to do
				the second step, for instance Clean Code or Design Patterns. I’m more
				interested in the first step. Some examples of the first step:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Should I add a rate limit on my application? Should I remove this
					feature, is it unused or being misused? … which falls under the camp
					of Should I add a feature?
				</li>
				<li>
					Why does this feature show for this customer but not for this
					customer? Why does this customer get an NPE?… which fall under the
					camp of Why is there a bug?
				</li>
				<li>
					How is the payment mechanism working and can I use it to add my
					feature more easily? Is there an internal api that already does this
					job? aka Can I add this feature cheaper?
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Now when we want to answer these questions, we actually have systems
				that can give us this information. By system, I mean either a set of
				habits, so can be relied upon e.g. git commits or a programmatic system
				e.g. an API.
			</p>

			<p>Some examples of such systems:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					The code itself; you can always read the code, whether you can
					understand it is an unrelated question. A benefit is that the code
					never lies, this is what is in production (after checking out the
					correct version).
				</li>
				<li>
					A work tracking tool, e.g. Jira, maybe you can search through the
					history and why find a certain change was made or why a decision was
					made. This is just an organised wiki, since it’s all edited by humans
					and can be updated by anyone at anytime.
				</li>
				<li>
					A wiki, a disorganised work tracking tool, with the added disadvantage
					that it is easy to not keep up to date. A pro is that if people are
					effective writers, then the wiki can be really useful.
				</li>
				<li>Official documentation of a tool.</li>
				<li>
					A historian, like a wiki but worse since humans are worse at
					remembering things than machines are, but better since only one editor
					is allowed.
				</li>
				<li>
					git commits - pro: very close to the code, con: relies on humans and
					effective communication, also has multiple styles.
				</li>
				<li>
					pull requests - similar to git commits but better for providing a
					higher level overview of a change
				</li>
				<li>source code host search, e.g. github search or gitlab search</li>
				<li>
					slack messages - since slack is a Searchable Log of All Communication
					and Knowledge, it is certainly a place to look for information.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cloud provider API/UI - e.g. AWS that can tell you the version that is
					currently in prod
				</li>
				<li>Metrics - e.g. ELK, Prometheus + Grafana</li>
				<li>Direct db queries</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Each system has a certain cost, to maintain it, and each system gets us
				some information with some degree of reliability. One of the problems I
				would like to think about is how to manage the set of systems an
				engineering team leverages in order to get the information they need for
				minimal cost? Another question, is that if one were to move to a new
				team, where the set of systems is different, or perhaps organised
				differently, how quickly can one orient themselves to the new set of
				systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				Picture this scenario: You work somewhere, and you are very used to the
				set of systems available to you. You change your working team, either by
				moving teams or by moving companies. The new team organises things
				totally differently, and you feel lost because you’re in a different
				kitchen. One can assume the new team has a set of systems, and is not
				just running around in the dark like magicians or mute historians. You
				exclaim, “Hey team, you are not using one of the systems I was reliant
				upon in my old team, and I feel out of place, can everyone start using
				my system?”. Maybe you’ve said these words, maybe you’ve heard them.
				Here’s a more concrete example: “Hey, can everyone put jira ticket ids
				in front of git commit messages and inside the git pull requests, I find
				it really useful and am annoyed that I’m the only one doing it”. Which
				leads to an interesting question of how does a system organically get
				added, and organically leave? By asking people, and annoying them into
				it like a cop, you feel angry for forcing them, and they feel angry for
				being micromanaged. Maybe the information that you want to introduce is
				only seen as valuable by you, maybe they have another system which you
				have not found yet which gathers that information?
			</p>

				If you have better names for any of the things I am talking about, or
				want to discuss them just leave me a message and some way of contacting
				you. Also if you know anyone who has written about this and already
				explored these topics, then give me a shout, I’d love to read up on
				this.
