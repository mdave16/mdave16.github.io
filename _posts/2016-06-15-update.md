I realise i don't update that much. So i felt maybe i should.


I wrote a website, it's hosted by PythonAnywhere. Pages are written in JS, HTML and CSS. CodeAcademy is a wonderful source for this if you are interested. The website itself runs on Flask, a python based wed framework. It's all quite simple, and I'll update this with the really easy to follow guides I used.

Once I had a basic website running, I personalised the CSS and made my own webpages. There's a 'building' tab in the menu so you can see what I'm working on. With the recent exams I haven't really had time to work on any of my own projects much. I'll try to churn out stuff when I can.
