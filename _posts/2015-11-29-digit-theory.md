Following on from MakeAMillion, I decided to label it under digit theory, since that is essentially what it is.

A paper can be found at the link above. More will come when I have time.

There are still so many topics I need to write up on.

The hockey stick theorem, Pisano numbers, +1 Primes, Integer Partitions... Soon

I'll be moving onto transcendence theory now, expect that one next.
