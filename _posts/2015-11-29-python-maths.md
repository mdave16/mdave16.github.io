So I should also note I created a module on Python, currently only using Python2.7. I don't plan to update it to Python 3, but might update depending on what I need.

The module can be found at either of the two links. Mostly they are just tester functions to confirm the material from before. I will try to make it more structured and make documentation more available. It's open source so do feel free to take and experiment with it, especially if you are interested in the earlier material.
