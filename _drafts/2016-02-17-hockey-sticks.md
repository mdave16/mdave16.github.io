Writing about web page https://files.warwick.ac.uk/mdave/files/HockeyStick.pdf

So this is me writing up the thing about the hockey stick theorem from first year. Was a nice find back then. I even got to do a talk about it and explain it to some college classes. Just to clarify â€“ this isn't world leading research, it's just a first year thinking ahead a little bit.
