So I should also note I created a module on python, currently only using Python2.7. I don't plan to update it to Python 3, but might do depending on what I need.

The module can be found at either of the two links. Mostly they are just tester functions to confirm the material from before. I will try to make it more structured and also make documentation more available. It's opensourse so do feel free to take and experiment with it, especially if you are interested by the earlier material.
