So to cement my skills at programming in python I wrote a base code for Project Euler. Currently just finishing problem #5.

This one is similar to my ones in C and Java (also available on the pastebin acc). Should be relatively quick to get started. Just have the file, give it a quick read through. I've added various comments for my example.

I may start a similar one in sage, and then give solutions to all problems I've solved so far in at least one language. After that, it's just translating.
