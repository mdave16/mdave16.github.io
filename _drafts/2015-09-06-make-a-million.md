Hey!

So I did some work finally! Check the link above.

If you want to build on it, or are struggling with any of it, just send me a message from the blog, or email me at m.dave (at) warwick.ac.uk

If you are interested, check out the pdf file, it should explain everything.

The python code is there for anyone who wants to build on it.

Results.txt shows all the findings, you can also do with that data as you will. I will learn how to format things properly soon and it will look pretty and useful.

If you are reading this much into the future, all the work will be in the "OldProjects" folder, under "MakeAMillion"

Mayur

EDIT: The link is now defunct. Will be hosting my material in the myfiles.warwick server. E-mail me if you want to see all the files in their entirity, but the main ones should be available anyway.
