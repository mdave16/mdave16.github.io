Hey!

So I did some work finally! Check the link above.

If you are interested, check out the pdf file, it should explain everything.

The python code is there for anyone who wants to build on it.

Results.txt shows all the findings, you can also do with that data as you will. I will learn how to format things properly soon, and it will look pretty and useful.
