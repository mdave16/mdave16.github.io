  URSS week 2:	

So I'd reflected on the first week before, and thought I'd do it for the other weeks too.

It seems I actually understood quite a bit of the theory wrong, this week has been quite unproductive in terms of getting far. I seem to slightly understand what I'm doing, but it's not really sinking in.

It goes off the work from Yasaki, Gunnels and also (Andrew) Jones's Thesis. I'm just struggling getting a few things to work. Marc has been really quite helpful in making sure I understand it all and helping me also code in sage by teaching me about shortcuts\methods which i'd not seen before.

I think I should be able to have a working program by Wednesday (I hope).

I also wanted to upload a clean/improved version of my essay on Complex Multiplication, which I will at some point.
