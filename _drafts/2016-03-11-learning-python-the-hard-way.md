Writing about web page http://www.pythonchallenge.com/

When I first learned how to code, it was mostly copy+paste and lots and lots of googling for the correct code.

Now when I find a problem, I like to think I can intuitively just figure it out and use code to help me. I came across this site and it's really fun and addictive, each of them uses python (or any other programming language) to solve a riddle which then allows you to pass to the next level.

As you may know, I am part of Technology Volunteers – we go into schools and teach them coding – mostly just C# and Block Coding/. Everynow and again, I try and come up with ways with which to excite them, and this could potentially be an answer.
