We haven't written anything yet, but me and a friend are looking at something we've called the 'span' of a set.

Basically, given a multiset, and a set of operations, what are all the numbers you can construct, when only using one number from the set exactly once. It seems to be quite a complicated question, and I think it would be part of Combinatorics/Graph Theory (since that's how we're rewriting a lot of the questions). We're going to work on it when we have some spare time and propably put the pdf on here when done.

<style>
header {
  padding: 2rem;
}
img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
p {
  font-size: 3rem
}
</style>
